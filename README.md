# Hospital-management-system
 Developed a console-based hospital management system in C that allows efficient handling of patient records. The system supports adding new patients, applying bonuses based on the number of medicines, searching for specific patients, sorting patients based on medicine count and payment, and retrieving the top-paying patients.
